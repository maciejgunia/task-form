# Task specific stuff

## Preview

Preview of the app is available [here](https://relaxed-bose-7d6ee8.netlify.app/)

## Notes about the task

-   I assumed that we are building a fairly generic form so I should be allowed to use external libraries.
-   I normally would have written tests at least for the happy path and probably some interesting edge cases, but it seemed like this is out of the scope here.
-   I think the form component is getting a bit big, maybe I would try to extract some of it into smaller components or at least helper functions (formik initialization or converting the image to base64 comes to mind).
-   I am pretty happy with the custom hook (useData) that retrieves and stores data in the session storage, it is quite simple but easily could be used to use http for example.
-   Ultimately I think styling is a bit of a mess - in some places I used Material in other inline css, partly due to not having a great experience with Material UI library, partly because of trying to keep this app very basic.
-   If this was a production app I cannot think of a reason not to use Typescript, again to keep it simple here I opted to not use it.
-   With more time I would love to add some more information to the user (e.g. loading state indication when it comes to async operations) and some fallbacks (e.g. don't show the info when it is empty) here again I opted to keep it relatively simple.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
